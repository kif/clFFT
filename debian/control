Description: clFFT is an open source OpenCL library implementation of FFT
 The FFT is an implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) that
 makes use of symmetries in the FFT definition to reduce the mathematical
 intensity required from O(N2) to O(N log2( N )) when the sequence length
 N is the product of small prime factors. Currently, there is no standard
 API for FFT routines. Hardware vendors usually provide a set of
 high-performance FFTs optimized for their systems: no two vendors employ
 the same interfaces for their FFT routines. clFFT provides a set of FFT
 routines that are optimized for AMD graphics processors, but also are
 functional across CPU and other compute devices.
